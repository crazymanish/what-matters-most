/*
- Scheduler implementations
- Apple provides several concrete implementations of the Scheduler protocol:
-----------
- `ImmediateScheduler:` A simple scheduler that executes code immediately on the current thread, which is the default execution context unless modified using subscribe(on:), receive(on:) or any of the other operators which take a scheduler as parameter.
- You can only use this scheduler for immediate actions. If you attempt to schedule actions after a specific date, this scheduler ignores the date and performs them immediately.
- https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/immediatescheduler
-----------
- `RunLoop:` Tied to Foundationâ€™s Thread object.
- `DispatchQueue:` Can either be serial or concurrent.
- `OperationQueue:` A queue that regulates the execution of work items.
