/// - `debounce(for:scheduler:options:)` Publishes elements only after a specified time interval elapses between events.
/// - https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publishers/reduce/debounce(for:scheduler:options:)
/// - Use the debounce(for:scheduler:options:) operator to control the number of values and time between delivery of values from the upstream publisher.
/// - This operator is useful to process bursty or high-volume event streams where you need to reduce the number of values delivered to the downstream to a rate you specify.
///
/// - For example, you may want to send a search URL request that returns a list of items matching whatâ€™s typed in the text field.
/// - But of course, you donâ€™t want to send a request every time your user types a single letter! You need some kind of mechanism to help pick up on typed text only when the user is done typing for a while.
/// - Combine offers two operators that can help you here: debounce and throttle.

         As you can see, at 0.6 seconds the user pauses and resumes typing only at 2.1 seconds.
         Meanwhile, you configured debounce to wait for a one-second pause. It obliges (at 1.6 seconds) and emits the latest received value.
         Same around the end where typing ends at 2.7 seconds and debounce kicks in one second later at 3.7 seconds. Cool!
