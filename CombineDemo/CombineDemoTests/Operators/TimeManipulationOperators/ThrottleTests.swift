/// - `throttle(for:scheduler:latest:)` Publishes either the most-recent or first element published by the upstream publisher in the specified time interval.
/// - https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publishers/reduce/throttle(for:scheduler:latest:)
/// - Use throttle(for:scheduler:latest:) to selectively republish elements from an upstream publisher during an interval you specify. Other elements received from the upstream in the throttling interval arenâ€™t republished.
///
/// - For example, you may want to send a search URL request that returns a list of items matching whatâ€™s typed in the text field.
/// - But of course, you donâ€™t want to send a request every time your user types a single letter! You need some kind of mechanism to help pick up on typed text only when the user is done typing for a while.
/// - Combine offers two operators that can help you here: debounce and throttle.
