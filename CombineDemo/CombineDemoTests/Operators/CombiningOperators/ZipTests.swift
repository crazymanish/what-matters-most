/// - `zip(_:)`Combines elements from another publisher and deliver pairs of elements as tuples.
/// - https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publishers/reduce/zip(_:)
///
/// - Use zip(_:) to combine the latest elements from two publishers and emit a tuple to the downstream. The returned publisher waits until both publishers have emitted an event, then delivers the oldest unconsumed event from each publisher together as a tuple to the subscriber.
/// - Much like a zipper or zip fastener on a piece of clothing pulls together rows of teeth to link the two sides, zip(_:) combines streams from two different publishers by linking pairs of elements from each side.
/// - In this example, numbers and letters are PassthroughSubjects that emit values; once zip(_:) receives one value from each, it publishes the pair as a tuple to the downstream subscriber. It then waits for the next pair of values.
///
/// - You might recognize this one from the Swift standard library method with the same name on Sequence types.
/// - This operator works similarly, emitting tuples of paired values in the same indexes. It waits for each publisher to emit an item, then emits a single tuple of items after all publishers have emitted an value at the current index.
/// - This means that if you are zipping two publishers, youâ€™ll get a single tuple emitted every time both publishers emit a value.
