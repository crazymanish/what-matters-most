/*
- Combine provides a few options around this:
 - It provides a publisher for any property of an object that is KVO (Key-Value Observing)-compliant.
 - The ObservableObject protocol handles cases where multiple variables could change.
----------
- `publisher(for:options:)` for key-value observing
- https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/performing-key-value-observing-with-combine
- This is mostly for ObjectiveC because Swift language doesnâ€™t directly support KVO, marking your properties `@objc dynamic` forces the compiler to generate hidden methods that trigger the KVO machinery.
----------
- `ObservableObject` A type of object with a publisher that emits before the object has changed.
- https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/observableobject
- By default an ObservableObject synthesizes an objectWillChange publisher that emits the changed value before any of its @Published properties changes.
